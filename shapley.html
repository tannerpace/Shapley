      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1951</strong> He introduced Shapley value. There he proposed that it might be possible to evaluate, in a numerical way, the “value” of playing a game. The particular function he derived for this purpose, which has come to be called the Shapley value, has been the focus of sustained interest among students of cooperative game theory ever since.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> Shapley went to Princeton University where he received a Ph.D.
